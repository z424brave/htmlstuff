      <h2 class="title txt-lt">MODDING TERMS</h2>
      <p>
        SEGA encourages its users to express their creativity and enhance the experience of the Total War franchise through the creation of modifications (including but not limited to new items, weapons, characters, models, textures, levels, story lines, music
        and game modes) for use with the Product (“<b>Mod</b>” or “<b>Mods</b>”). In order to protect SEGA, the Product, any third party licensors that have licensed intellectual property to Sega for use in the Product, and users that create Mods,
        the following terms apply (“<b>Modding Terms</b>”). Please review these rules carefully before you create, share, distribute, use or otherwise exploit any Mods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that laws in your respective jurisdiction may require that you are of a certain age in order to enter into legally binding arrangements such as the terms of this Modding Terms. In the event that you are under the required age, you may not
        create any Mods, unless your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms. The licence we provide to you to create and use Mods with the Product may be revoked if you breach the Modding Terms.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-wrapper">
      <h2 class="title txt-lt">1. OWNERSHIP</h2>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that you shall have no ownership or other proprietary interest in the Product and/or any Mods which you create, except as expressly stated herein. Any Mods that you create shall belong to you only insofar as the Mod contains your original
        creative work. You acknowledge and agree that all right, title and interest in any elements of the Mod which represent, comprise, derive or are based upon any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Product (including but not limited
        to any computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialogs, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, images, animation, sounds, musical compositions, audio-visual effects or text), including without limitation copyrights,
        trademarks and other intellectual properties therein and/or related thereto, whether or not registered or registrable, are owned by, or for the benefit of SEGA and its licensors.

      <h2 class="title txt-lt">2. LICENCE</h2>
      <p>
        Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of the EULA and the Modding Terms, SEGA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, fully revocable right and licence to install, access and use the in-game modding tools and any
        other related tools provided by SEGA (“Modding Tools”) solely and exclusively to create Mods for use with the Product and to publish those Mods to the Total War™: Warhammer® Steam Workshop Modding page (“<b>Modding Page</b>”) available
        at <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/workshop" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/app/364360/workshop</a>, or as updated from time to time, which is owned and operated by Valve. Please visit Valve’s website for more
        details: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">http://store.steampowered.com/</a> Please note that Valve is a third party platform and this link is provided for your information only. You acknowledge and agree that your use
        of the Steam platform and the Modding Page is at your own discretion and risk and that you will be solely responsible for any obligations, damages or losses which arise from your registration, access and use of this service.

      </p>
      <p>
        You agree to use the Modding Tools to create Mods in a manner that is consistent with this Agreement, including an agreement that you shall not sell, rent, lease, licence, distribute or otherwise transfer or exploit the Modding Tools and/or Mods or any
        copies thereof, for commercial gain or otherwise, except as permitted by this Agreement, which means that you may only publish the Mod to the Modding Page. A breach of the provisions of this licence shall constitute a material breach which has
        the effect of terminating the EULA (including the Modding Terms) and which may subject you to civil and criminal liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        In consideration of the above grant of rights, you hereby grant SEGA, its affiliates and its licensors all the necessary consents, clearances and an irrevocable, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual licence and right to use, reproduce, modify,
        adapt, display, distribute or otherwise exploit any Mod which is uploaded to the Modding Page in any way SEGA or its licensors see fit for use with the Product and any other products published by SEGA. You waive and agree never to assert against
        SEGA or its affiliates, distributors or licensors any moral rights or similar rights, however designated, that you may have in or to any Mods.

    <div class="section-wrapper">
      <h2 class="title txt-lt">3. CONTENT RESTRICTIONS</h2>
      <div>
        Any element which you include in your Mod must be your own original work created by you or you must have obtained the necessary permissions to use such materials. You are responsible for the content of any Mods which you create and publish on the Modding
        Page and shall warrant and represent to SEGA that your Mods do not contain:
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          any materials which are discriminatory, racist, obscene, libelous, offensive, illegal, defamatory, inappropriate, invasive, or likely to adversely affect the reputation or goodwill of SEGA and/or its licensors;
        </li>
        <li>
          any resemblance to any recognisable third party brand, character or personality, including but not limited to any trademark, logos or third party assets except for those assets provided to you by SEGA as necessary for the creation of the Mod for use with
          the Product;
        </li>
        <li>
          any third party assets, from other games published by SEGA and its affiliates or any other third party;
        </li>
        <li>
          any materials which do not comply with any additional instructions provided to you by SEGA as published on the Modding Page which may be updated by SEGA from time to time;
        </li>
        <li>
          any malicious code, including viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots, corrupted data, or other content that contains malicious code or in any way damages or interfere with the operation of the Product.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        SEGA does not pre-vet or monitor any Mods which are uploaded to the Modding Page and does not monitor, endorse or approve any Mods. You are solely responsible for your Mod and may be held liable for any Mod which you create and upload to the Modding Page.
        SEGA reserves the right, in its sole and final discretion, to request that Valve remove any Mods from the Modding Page which violate the content restrictions above. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, SEGA does not assume any responsibility
        or liability for the Mods or for removal of, Mods or any failure to or delay in removing, such Mods.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-wrapper">
      <h2 class="title txt-lt">4. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend and hold SEGA and its parent companies, affiliates, licensees, contractors, officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from any damages, losses, cost and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising directly or indirectly
        from any acts and omissions associated with the use of any Mod which you create and publish, including but not limited to any allegation that the Mod violates the copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or other intellectual property or other
        rights of any third party, or any other violation by you of the terms of the Modding Terms.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-wrapper">
      <h2 class="title txt-lt">5. OUR LIABILITY</h2>
      <p>
        WE PROVIDE THE PRODUCT, THE MODDING TOOLS AND ANY MODS ON AN “<b>AS IS</b>” BASIS AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY DISPUTE WITH SEGA IS TO STOP USING THE PRODUCT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE MODDING TOOLS AND/OR ANY MODS). IN NO EVENT SHALL SEGA AND ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
        INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER
        IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE PRODUCT, THE MODDING TOOLS AND ANY MODS. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
        CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, THE LIABILITY OF SEGA AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-wrapper">
      <h2 class="title txt-lt">6. TERMINATION</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend access to, or terminate the licence for, any Mods, Modding Tools and the Modding Page at any time for any reason. If you commit any breach of clauses 2 and 3 of the Modding Terms, the licence to use the Product, the Modding
        Tools and/or any Mods shall automatically terminate, without notice. Your grant of the licence to SEGA to use any Mods which you create and publish to the Modding Page shall survive termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because SEGA would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, you agree that SEGA shall be entitled to take such action as may be required, including seeking an injunction and other equitable remedies, in addition
        to any other remedies available to it under the applicable law.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-wrapper">
      <h2 class="title txt-lt">7. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
      <p>
        This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and SEGA concerning Mods, the Modding Tools and the Modding Page and supersedes all prior agreements and representations, warranties or understandings between you and SEGA (whether negligently
        or innocently made but excluding those made fraudulently), regarding the same subject matter.  SEGA reserves the right to amend or modify these terms at any time, in any manner, without any liability to SEGA and at SEGA’s sole discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty, disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will
        be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in effect.  Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provision of this
        Agreement or related rights shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEGA may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time.  Notwithstanding, you may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under the Agreement without SEGA’s express prior written consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in this Agreement gives or claims to give to any third party any benefit or right to enforce any term of this Agreement, and the provisions of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 (as amended or modified from time to time) are expressly
        excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Agreement shall be construed under laws of England and Wales, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.
